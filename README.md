# Chess Database
This is a project that I built using ReactJS, Express, and mySQL. The interface allows the user to play out chess games and load/view games played by top players on Lichess.org. When the user makes a move on the board, the intereface automatically updates with the win rates for moves perviously tried in the current position, and with a list of top player games from that position. The user can then either continue making moves, takeback moves, overwrite a previously played move, or load a game from the top games list. The backend currently supports 1.2 million games, totalling over 120 million rows of moves. Below is a video demo of the project.
